We are organizing the sharing lessons learned session to transfer the the knowledge from the four partner companies (CourseSquare, ProGaming, Roots, and Zwiz.AI) in the form of a panel discussion about the challenges that they faced in their software development and the experience of adopting automated software engineering tools such as unit testing frameworks and SonarQube. Dr. Jens Krinke also shared his view on the state-of-the-art in automated software engineering and how it would help the software companies in Thailand to improve their software quality and productivity of the team.

### Seminar: Now You See Me: Understand Your Software with Code Analysis Using SonarQube
#### 16 June 2022 1-5 pm (Thailand time) Online (Webex Meeting)
<img width="300px" src="https://muict-seru.github.io/img/seminars/ASETSI_Workshop2_poster.jpeg" />

We are organizing the second seminar to transfer the ASE knowledge to Thailand's software industry on the topic of "Now You See Me: Understand Your Software with Code Analysis Using SonarQube". The seminar will be conducted by the 3 researchers at SERU: Asst. Prof. Dr. Thanwadee Sunetnanta, 
Dr. Morakot Choetkiertikul, and Dr. Chaiyong Ragkhitwetsagul. We will present the concept of software measurement and metrics, followed by code smells and code refactoring. Lastly, we will cover the basic testing concept and automated testing. The participant will have a hands-on exercise by using SonarQube to analyze an open source software project to understand how the presented concepts can be used in practice.

## July 2021
### Seminar: Continuous integration, continuous inspection, and automated code review
#### 29-30 July 2021 2-5 pm (Thailand time) Online (Zoom Meeting)
<img width="300px" src="[https://muict-seru.github.io/img/seminars/ASETSI_Workshop1_poster.jpeg](https://github.com/MUICT-SERU/ASETSI/blob/master/images/ASETSI_Workshop1_poster.jpeg?raw=true)" />

We have organized the first seminar to transfer the ASE knowledge from the UK to Thailand on the topic of "Continuous integration, continuous inspection, and automated code review" on 29-30 July 2021 2-5 pm (2 days) via Zoom meeting. The seminar is lead by Dr. Jens Krinke, Associate Professor, Director of the Centre for Research on Evolution Search & Testing (CREST) in the Software Systems Engineering Group, UCL, UK, which covers the concept of automated software engineering (ASE) including continuous integration, continuous inspection, and automated code review, and their adoption in software projects. The ASE tools and techniques aim to improve the quality of the software and software development process with minimum human intervention. This workshop is for software companies, researchers, instructors, and students who are interested in software engineering methodologies.

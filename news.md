We are organizing the second seminar to transfer the ASE knowledge to Thailand's software industry on the topic of "Now You See Me: Understand Your Software with Code Analysis Using SonarQube". The seminar will be conducted by the 3 researchers at SERU: Asst. Prof. Dr. Thanwadee Sunetnanta, 
Dr. Morakot Choetkiertikul, and Dr. Chaiyong Ragkhitwetsagul. We will present the concept of software measurement and metrics, followed by code smells and code refactoring. Lastly, we will cover the basic testing concept and automated testing. The participant will have a hands-on exercise by using SonarQube to analyze an open source software project to understand how the presented concepts can be used in practice.

We have organized the first seminar to transfer the ASE knowledge from the UK to Thailand on the topic of "Continuous integration, continuous inspection, and automated code review" on 29-30 July 2021 2-5 pm (2 days) via Zoom meeting. The seminar is lead by Dr. Jens Krinke, Associate Professor, Director of the Centre for Research on Evolution Search & Testing (CREST) in the Software Systems Engineering Group, UCL, UK, which covers the concept of automated software engineering (ASE) including continuous integration, continuous inspection, and automated code review, and their adoption in software projects. The ASE tools and techniques aim to improve the quality of the software and software development process with minimum human intervention. This workshop is for software companies, researchers, instructors, and students who are interested in software engineering methodologies.
